# Advent of Code 2016

Just like last year (and maybe the years before I don't know about that) [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) created 
the perfect Advent Calendar for programmers, [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). Last year I solved 
the first few puzzles using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) but after a while I forgot about it and missed the end. 

This year I chose [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) to solve the puzzles which will be a real challange as my 
knowledge of the language is near 0, but this game looks like a good way to learn it.

## Questions
### Will you solve every challange?
I would love to say yes, but knowing myself it's likely that my enthusiasm will end and I won't do more puzzles, although I
hope I'm wrong.

### Only Haskell?
That's my plan for now but it may change in the future.

### Why Haskell?
I always liked the idea of functional programming, and Haskell seems a good choice, although Scala might be closer to
me because of the JVM.
